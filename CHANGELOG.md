## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Added an `embassy` feature, making `embassy-net` and `embassy-time` optional dependencies.
- Added `HttpClient` and `HttpClientRequest` for running the HTTP client over any already-connected `embedded-io-async` stream without Embassy.
- Added `HttpTlsClient` for running TLS over any already-connected `embedded-io-async` stream without Embassy when `tls` is enabled. The client stores a `TlsVerification` policy: `TlsVerification::Verified` checks the certificate chain against a pinned root CA, the hostname, and (with a clock supplying Unix time) the validity period via `embedded-tls`'s no_std `rustpki` backend; `TlsVerification::Unverified` skips certificate checks and remains vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Added `HttpServer` and `handle_http_connection()` for serving a single HTTP connection over any `embedded-io-async` stream without Embassy.
- Added optional `smoltcp` feature with `SmolTcpStream`, an `embedded-io-async` adapter for `smoltcp` TCP sockets.
- Added `TimeoutDuration`, a transport-neutral duration type for `HttpClientOptions`.
- Added `HttpClient::request_with_retry_delay()` and `HttpTlsClient::request_with_retry_delay()`, which sleep between read retries via a caller-provided delay; the Embassy-backed clients use this to honor `HttpClientOptions::retry_delay`.
- Added `HttpEndpoint` and `parse_endpoint()` to the crate root re-exports.
- Added CI coverage for `--no-default-features` and `--no-default-features --features tls`.
- Documented the TLS verification guarantees of each `TlsVerification` policy and the man-in-the-middle risk of unverified HTTPS.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `HttpClientOptions` now uses `TimeoutDuration` instead of `embassy_time::Duration`.
- **BREAKING**: Transport error variants no longer expose Embassy error types directly; `DnsError`, `ConnectionError`, and `TcpError` are now transport-neutral variants. Note that stream IO errors on the TLS path are now reported as `TcpError` (previously `TlsError`); TLS handshake errors remain `TlsError`.
- **BREAKING**: The `embassy` feature is no longer enabled by default. Enable `features = ["embassy"]` to use Embassy-backed adapters.
- **BREAKING**: Transport-generic client/server APIs dropped the `Io` infix: `HttpClient`, `HttpClientRequest`, `HttpTlsClient`, `HttpServer`, `DefaultHttpClient`, `DefaultHttpServer`, etc.
- **BREAKING**: Embassy-backed client/server root exports are now explicitly named `DefaultEmbassyHttpClient`, `EmbassyHttpClient`, `SmallEmbassyHttpClient`, `DefaultEmbassyHttpServer`, `EmbassyHttpServer`, and `SmallEmbassyHttpServer`.
- **BREAKING**: `ServerTimeouts` now uses `TimeoutDuration` values instead of raw `u64` seconds and is available only with the `embassy` feature; `HttpServer::with_buffer_sizes()` was renamed to `HttpServer::new()` (buffer sizes are type parameters).
- `SmallHttpClient` now uses a 512-byte request buffer (previously identical to the 1024-byte `DefaultHttpClient`).
- Embassy-backed clients now sleep for `HttpClientOptions::retry_delay` between read retries.
- Embassy-backed client and server modules are now gated behind the `embassy` feature.
- Internal layout is now hexagonal: `client/` and `server/` contain transport-neutral IO adapters plus Embassy adapters.

### Fixed

- Incomplete responses no longer silently return truncated bodies: the client returns `InvalidResponse` when a length-delimited body is cut short by connection close, and `BufferOverflow` when the response exceeds the caller's buffer.
- Incomplete requests no longer silently reach the handler: the server returns `InvalidResponse` on premature close and `BufferOverflow` when a request exceeds the request buffer.
- Fixed integer overflow in the server's request completion check for absurd `Content-Length` values.
- Chunked responses with intermediate transfer codings (e.g. `Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked`) are now dechunked correctly.
- TLS handshake seed now uses the low 32 bits of the system tick counter and never collapses to the all-zero XORShift state.
- Removed a redundant per-response copy of the parsed header list.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added zero-copy request target and query helpers on `HttpRequest`:
  - `target()` returns the raw request target.
  - `route_path()` returns the path without the query string.
  - `query_string()` returns the raw query string.
  - `query_pairs()` iterates raw query parameter pairs.
  - `query()`, `query_first()`, `query_last()`, `query_all()`, `query_indexed()`, and `query_param()` provide URLSearchParams-style access while preserving duplicate keys.
- Added request convenience helpers: `header()`, `body_str()`, `content_type()`, and `content_length()`.
- Added `percent_decode()` for explicit, no-allocation query component decoding into a caller-provided buffer.
- Re-exported `QueryPair`, `QueryPairs`, `QueryValues`, and `percent_decode` from the crate root.

### Notes

- Query helpers return raw, undecoded values by default.
- Duplicate query keys are preserved.
- Bracket-style query names such as `f[0]` are treated literally.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- `HttpHandler::handle_request` now takes `&mut self` instead of `&self`.

## [0.11.9] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `HttpResponseBuilder` with fluent API for flexible response construction:
  - `status(code)` — set HTTP status
  - `header(name, value)` / `headers(&[hdr])` — add custom headers
  - `content_type(ct)` — set Content-Type header
  - `json(body)` — sets `Content-Type: application/json` + text body
  - `problem_json(body)` — sets `Content-Type: application/problem+json` + text body (RFC 7807)
  - `text(body)` / `binary(data)` / `empty_body()` — set body
  - `build()` → `Result<HttpResponse>` — builds with header dedup (last value wins)
- `mime_types::PROBLEM_JSON` constant for RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs

### Removed

- **YANKED**: v0.11.8 convenience constructors (`json()`, `text()`, `not_found()`, `bad_request()`) - poorly designed, too opinionated
  - `json()` was hardcoded to 200 OK (invalid for error responses)
  - `bad_request()` was hardcoded to `text/plain` (invalid for RFC 7807 JSON errors)
  - Not flexible enough for real-world API patterns

### Migration Guide (from 0.11.8)

**Before (removed):**
```rust,ignore
HttpResponse::json(r#"{"status":"ok"}"#)          // hardcoded 200
HttpResponse::bad_request("missing parameter")    // hardcoded text/plain
```

**After (builder):**
```rust,ignore
// JSON success
HttpResponseBuilder::new().json(r#"{"status":"ok"}"#)?.build()?

// JSON error (RFC 7807)
HttpResponseBuilder::new()
    .status(StatusCode::BadRequest)
    .problem_json(r#"{"type":"https://example.com/probs/invalid","title":"Invalid parameter"}"#)?
    .build()?

// Text with custom Content-Type
HttpResponseBuilder::new()
    .status(StatusCode::NotFound)
    .content_type(mime_types::TEXT)?
    .text("Not Found")
    .build()?
```

## [0.11.8] - YANKED (2026-06-03)

**Yanked due to poorly designed convenience constructors.** See v0.11.9 for replacement builder pattern.

## [0.11.7] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- SSE-friendly header helpers for `text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control`, and `Connection`.
- `HttpResponse::build_head_bytes` for header-only responses, which makes streaming endpoints easier to wire up in embedded handlers.

### Changed

- Updated the README to call out the HTTP server path for embedded APIs such as Puck.


## [0.11.6] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Strict clippy configuration following nulid pattern: forbids `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic`/`todo`/`unimplemented` in production code (tests allow these via `.clippy.toml`), enables pedantic and nursery lints at warn level.

### Changed

- Replaced `rand_chacha` dependency with tiny XORShift32 PRNG for TLS seeding (keeps `rand_core 0.6` required by embedded-tls, removes rand 0.10.x conflict).
- Added `const` to all functions that can be made `const` (`ResponseBody::as_bytes`, `ResponseBody::is_empty`, `ResponseBody::len`, `StatusCode::as_u16`, `StatusCode::text`, `ServerTimeouts::new`, `HttpServer::with_timeouts`, `XorShift32Rng::new`).
- Use `Self` instead of type names within impls (`StatusCode`, `Error`, `HttpMethod`, `ResponseBody`).
- Simplified `if let/else` patterns to `map_or`/`map_or_else` for better code clarity.
- Added `Eq` derives to enums with `PartialEq` (`HttpMethod`, `InvalidHttpMethod`).
- Replace `unwrap()` with safe array indexing for `timeseed()` in TLS seeding.
- Used `#[expect(clippy::future_not_send)]` instead of `#[allow(...)]` for embedded async functions (documents intent and alerts if futures become `Send`).

### Fixed

- All 197 clippy warnings (pedantic/nursery lints) fixed without `#[allow(...)]` directives (except expected `future_not_send` for embedded no_std).

## [0.11.5] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- `Error::BufferOverflow` variant for request/response buffer overflow errors.
- Server read loop: accumulates data across multiple TCP segments until headers and `Content-Length` body are fully received.
- IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack DNS resolution: tries A (IPv4) first, falls back to AAAA (IPv6).

### Fixed

- Client read loop now returns error on retry exhaustion instead of parsing partial/truncated data.
- Empty URL path (e.g. `http://example.com`) now defaults to `"/"` instead of producing an invalid request line.
- Handler timeout now returns `408 Request Timeout` instead of `400 Bad Request`.
- Duplicate `Content-Length` header no longer emitted when caller already provides one in `build_bytes`.
- `build_bytes` now returns `Result` and reports `BufferOverflow` instead of silently truncating.
- `ResponseBody::Empty.as_str()` now returns `None` instead of `Some("")`.
- Client handles missing or invalid `Content-Length` (e.g. Traefik stripping headers) by reading until connection close.

### Changed

- Enabled both `proto-ipv4` and `proto-ipv6` in `embassy-net` features for dual-stack support.
- Extracted `resolve_host` helper to deduplicate DNS resolution between HTTP and HTTPS paths.
- Replaced all hardcoded HTTP strings in production code with constants from `protocol.rs` and `header.rs` (`CONTENT_TYPE`, `CONTENT_LENGTH`, `HEADER_SEPARATOR`, `HTTP_VERSION_PREFIX`, `mime_types::*`).
- Server error responses extracted into `text_error_response` helper (DRY).
- `handle_connection` changed from `&mut self` to `&self`.
- `try_push!` macro now returns `Error::BufferOverflow` instead of `Error::InvalidResponse`.
- Removed dead `url_parts` vec and `MAX_URL_PARTS` constant from URL parsing.
- Socket timeout reset after accept to avoid racing with read timeout.
- Removed blanket `#[allow(dead_code)]` on `StatusCode` impl.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Support for `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` responses. Chunked bodies are decoded in-place before parsing ([#29](https://github.com/rttfd/nanofish/issues/29)).
- New `protocol` module with shared HTTP constants (`CRLF`, `DOUBLE_CRLF`, `MAX_HEADERS`, `HTTP_VERSION`, port defaults) and utilities (`find_double_crlf`, `find_crlf`, `find_header_value`).

### Fixed

- Removed unsafe dangling pointer usage from README examples ([#28](https://github.com/rttfd/nanofish/issues/28)).

### Changed

- Refactored codebase to eliminate magic numbers and duplicated constants (SOLID/DRY).
- Consolidated `MAX_HEADERS` into a single definition in `protocol` module (was defined separately in `client.rs`, `request.rs`, and hardcoded in `response.rs`).
- Replaced scattered `windows(4).position(...)` patterns with shared `protocol::find_double_crlf` and `protocol::find_crlf` utilities.
- Bumped `defmt` from `1.0.1` to `1.1.0`.
- Bumped `heapless` from `0.9.2` to `0.9.3`.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Fixed requests failing with `Error::InvalidResponse("Invalid HTTP response encoding")` on binary responses (e.g., PNG images). The HTTP response parser now only requires headers to be valid UTF-8, not the entire response body ([#26](https://github.com/rttfd/nanofish/issues/26)).

### Changed

- Bumped `embassy-net` from `0.9.0` to `0.9.1`.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Fixed `log` feature not enabling `embassy-net/log`, causing compile failures when using the `log` feature.
- Removed `defmt` from `embassy-net` default features (was accidentally always enabled).

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- Bumped `embassy-net` from `0.8.0` to `0.9.0`.
- Bumped `embassy-time` from `0.5.0` to `0.5.1`.
- Bumped `heapless` from `0.9.1` to `0.9.2`.
- Bumped `futures-lite` from `2.0` to `2.6`.
- Bumped MSRV to `1.91` (required by `heapless` 0.9.2 and `smoltcp` 0.13.0).
- Updated `Makefile` to use `rust-version` from `Cargo.toml` and align with CI workflows.
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use `actions/checkout@v5` and `actions/cache@v5` (Node.js 24 compatible).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `HttpHandler::handle_request` now takes `&self` instead of `&mut self`. Handlers that need mutation can use interior mutability (e.g., `RefCell`, atomics).
- Added `Makefile` with targets for `fmt`, `fmt-check`, `clippy`, `clippy-all`, `test`, `test-all`, `ci`, and `publish`.
- CI workflows now use `make` commands.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- `defmt` feature flag — `defmt` is now optional instead of always enabled.
- `log` feature flag — alternative logging backend using the `log` crate.
- Unified logging macros (`trace!`, `debug!`, `info!`, `warn!`, `error!`) that dispatch to `defmt`, `log`, or no-op depending on the enabled feature.
- Compile-time guard preventing both `defmt` and `log` features from being enabled simultaneously.
- `socket.flush()` call after writing responses in the HTTP server.
- CI workflow matrix testing all valid feature combinations.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `defmt` is no longer a hard dependency — users must opt in via `features = ["defmt"]`.
- **BREAKING**: Bumped `embassy-net` from `0.7.1` to `0.8.0`.
- **BREAKING**: Bumped `embedded-io-async` from `0.6.1` to `0.7.0`.
- **BREAKING**: Bumped `embedded-tls` from `0.17.0` to `0.18.0` (new `UnsecureProvider` API).
- Server logging now uses the unified logging macros instead of calling `defmt` directly.
- Client logging now uses the unified logging macros instead of calling `defmt` directly.
- CI workflows no longer use `--all-features` (incompatible with mutually exclusive `defmt`/`log` features).

### Removed

- Direct `defmt` dependency from the default build — it is now behind a feature gate.
- Unused `NoVerify` import from the TLS client code.

### Fixed

- Server failed to compile without the `defmt` feature due to bare `defmt::warn!` / `defmt::info!` calls.
- CI workflows failed with `--all-features` due to mutually exclusive `defmt` and `log` features.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-04-16

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Added const generic parameter `RQ` for HTTP request buffer size.
- **BREAKING**: Added const generics for TCP and TLS buffer sizes (`TCP_RX`, `TCP_TX`, `TLS_READ`, `TLS_WRITE`).
- Introduced `DefaultEmbassyHttpClient` and `SmallEmbassyHttpClient` type aliases.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-04-13

### Changed

- Renamed `reason_phrase` to `text` on `StatusCode`.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-04-13

### Added
